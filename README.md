## On-chain analytics projects
Here we have 5 projects for each topic, NFT, DeFi, and DEX.

Each topic was introduced and projects should be submitted at 5, 6, and 7th week of the course, respectively.


## Project samples
Here are the samples that I provided for students the previous week of the project submission.

The samples are intened for students to explore how data structures look like on [Flipside Crypto](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/) and refresh SQL.
